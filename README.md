# OpportunityGeeks

Opportunity Geeks was a project which I made  , The motivation behind it was that All the official work related to placement opportunities for final year students floated upon Whatsapp groups by our College TPO, and it was inevitable for some students to miss some message and not being able to follow the deadlines to fill certain forms as all the circulation was very informal so I took the intiative to build Opportunity Geeks portal for college tpo which was Two way functioning Web App where students can login with there credentials and recieve information about any new job posting on campus and off campus by email notification , also they do not need to fill lengthy google forms for each job opening they fill , , also tpo officials can use it to upload new oppurtinities in a post like structure , I took help of Javascript , Bootstrap to build the front end of the web app and even took the responsibility to include Dark theme for better user experience , the features this web app offers are tremendous not only about posting job openings TPO admin can maintain data/ lists of students who are eligible to sit for companies or not based on the CGPA and re appear requirements and there is feature to take data in whatever needed format JSON, CSV or even word docx or pdf, For developing the backend I used node js for all the get and post requests and the database i used in my project was MongoDB.
